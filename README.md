DESCRIPTION

A synergistic set of audio implementation tools for the interface of Unity game engine and FMOD audio middleware.

- Assorted triggering, playback and randomization features
- Integration with various Unity subsystems (Timeline, Animator, Animation Clips etc.)
- Ambience area system for implementing seamless door transitions and large sound sources 
- Reverb zone system with blend areas
- Third person footstep system (no animation keyframe tagging required)
- Surface tagging and detection system (both mesh and Terrain texture -based) 
- Voiceover system with dialogue queuing and pacing tools
- Room-portal -based sound occlusion system 
- Raycast-based obstruction 

DOCUMENTATION

*A major rewrite of the whole toolset was pushed on 14.10.22, which made most of the previously available documentation obsolete. I will do my best to get the documentation updated in the near future.*

Third party dependencies:

- FMOD version: 2.02.09 (Unity verified)
- Tested in Unity version: 2021.3.7f1 (LTS)
